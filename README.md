## Introduction


This website is a fan page for Tenjin style, where you can find and buy cool desk mats. I started this project when I was trying to experiment with fetching data.

I built the project using React and some helpful tools like Tailwind CSS, Axios, and other React stuff.

Feel free to contact me if you have questions or suggestions! :D
